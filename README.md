Group Big Brain Learning ðŸ¤” 

The Universal Transformer model can be found in `universal_transformer.py`.
Scripts to process the data can be found in `preprocess.py`.
The script to train the model is `assignment.py`. It produces two output files that can be used to compute BLEU scores using `bleu.sh`. Note that `bleu.sh` requires the `sacrebleu` Python package, which can be installed with `pip install sacrebleu`.

Included are `.sh` files to download the necessary data.
